# Solution Logic
- Make the body a flex box, since we only have to use 1 div.
- IMP: Set height for the body as complete view port.
- align items: center will work.
- Horizontal alignment is easy with flex with justify content but the catch was the vertical alignment.
- So body will be treated as the parent div to start the flexbox.
